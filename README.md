Hey there, I'm Josh Nguyen
- I'm a PhD student at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu), University of Pennsylvania.
- I develop (computational) tools to study human behavior, individual and collective. My current focus is [commonsense knowledge and reasoning](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/project/common-sense).
- Previously I was at the [Computational Media Lab](https://cmlab.dev/), Australian National University.
- My papers can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mmy1v8oAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) page.
- My [personal website](https://joshnguyen.net) may also have things you're looking for. I occasionally write posts about machine learning and optimization on this site, too.
